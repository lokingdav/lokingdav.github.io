I'm **David L. Adei**, a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/){:target="_blank"} and a member of the [Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research (WSPR) Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/people.html){:target="_blank"}. I am advised by [Dr. Brad Reaves](https://bradreaves.net){:target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on systems security and privacy-preserving technologies. Currently, I‚Äôm developing novel defenses to secure telephone networks, combat telecom fraud, and extend the STIR/SHAKEN caller authentication ecosystem.

My first Ph.D. paper, **J√§ger: Automated Telephone Call Traceback**, received both the [**Distinguished Paper Award**](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2024/program/awards.html#:~:text=Kim%2C%20H.%20Lee-,J%C3%A4ger%3A%20Automated%20Telephone%20Call%20Traceback,-Authors%3A%20D.%20Adei){:target="_blank"} and [**Distinguished Artifact Award**](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2024/program/awards.html#:~:text=the%20Function%20Granularity-,J%C3%A4ger%3A%20Automated%20Telephone%20Call%20Traceback,-DarthShader%3A%20Fuzzing%20WebGPU){:target="_blank"} at ACM CCS 2024.
