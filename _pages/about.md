I am a security researcher dedicated to building systems that protect people from fraud and privacy invasions. My current focus is on retrofitting the global telephone network, where I develop new defenses to combat robocalls and authenticate callers.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I am a member of the [Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research (WSPR) Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/people.html){:target="_blank"}, advised by [Dr. Brad Reaves](https://bradreaves.net){:target="_blank"}.

My foundational Ph.D. work, [**JÃ¤ger: Automated Telephone Call Traceback**](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2024/program/awards.html#:~:text=Kim%2C%20H.%20Lee-,J%C3%A4ger%3A%20Automated%20Telephone%20Call%20Traceback,-Authors%3A%20D.%20Adei){:target="_blank"}, provides one of the first automated methods for tracing fraudulent calls to their source. This research was honored with both the **Distinguished Paper Award** and the **Distinguished Artifact Award** at ACM CCS 2024.

I am on track to graduate in **Spring 2026** and am actively seeking full-time research or engineering roles where I can solve impactful, real-world security challenges.
