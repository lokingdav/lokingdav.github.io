I'm **David L. Adei** (formally Dawuda Ahmed), a Ph.D student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, advised by [Dr. Brad Reaves](https://bradreaves.net){:target="_blank"}. 

My research centers on systems security and privacy-preserving technologies, with a current focus on developing advanced techniques to secure telephone networks, mitigate telecom fraud, and expand the STIR/SHAKEN caller authentication framework. 

My first PhD paper (dubbed JÃ¤ger) earned both the [Distinguished Paper Award](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2024/program/awards.html#:~:text=Kim%2C%20H.%20Lee-,J%C3%A4ger%3A%20Automated%20Telephone%20Call%20Traceback,-Authors%3A%20D.%20Adei){:target="_blank"} and [Distinguished Artifact Award](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2024/program/awards.html#:~:text=the%20Function%20Granularity-,J%C3%A4ger%3A%20Automated%20Telephone%20Call%20Traceback,-DarthShader%3A%20Fuzzing%20WebGPU){:target="_blank"} at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) in October 2024.

This site features information about my **research**, **publications**, and **projects**. Feel free to explore and don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in **collaborations** or **discussions**!
