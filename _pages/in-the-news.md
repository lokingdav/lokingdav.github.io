  We have been invited to give a talk on **Secure and Efficient Out-of-Band Call Metadata Transmission** for telephone networks at the upcoming [SIP Network Operators Conference (SIPNOC) 2025](https://www.sipforum.org/news-events/sipnoc-2025-overview/){:target="_blank"}. SIPNOC is a premier industry event for the SIP and VoIP community, and I’m excited to share our research with industry experts and practitioners. The conference will be held at at the Hyatt Regency Dulles Hotel in Herndon, Virginia from **September 16-18, 2025**. Our session is is scheduled (tentatively) on the 18, 1:30pm-2:00pm.

  Our paper **How to Recover a Cryptographic Secret From the Cloud** was accepted to the **ACM CCS 2025**. This work is a collaboration with Tanner Verber, Alessandra Scafuro, and Chris Orsini. In this paper, we explore new approaches for secure secret recovery in cloud environments—a topic that’s increasingly important as more critical infrastructure relies on cloud services.

  I’ve been awarded the **College of Engineering Summer Graduate Merit Award** at North Carolina State University! It’s an incredible honor to be recognized among a small group of outstanding graduate students across the College. This award comes with a $3,000 cash prize for no additional work.

  Our paper **Towards Declarative Blockchains: A SHACL-Based Model for Robust and Efficient Transactions** was accepted to the **IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (ICBC) 2025**. This work is a collaboration with Kemafor Anyanwu and  Sogolsadat Mansouri. We propose a novel approach to enhance the robustness and efficiency of blockchain transactions using SHACL, a W3C standard for validating RDF data.

  Our paper [**Jäger: Automated Telephone Call Traceback**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02839){:target="_blank"} was accepted to **ACM CCS 2024**. This work is a collaboration with Varun Madathil, Sathvik Prasad, Bradley Reaves and Alessandra Scafuro. We developed a system that enables automated traceback of telephone calls to their origin, even in the presence of partial deployment. This is a significant step forward in combating robocalls and enhancing the security of telephone networks.
