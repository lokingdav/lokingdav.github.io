## Awards & Honors

* **May 12, 2025**: I received the **College of Engineering Summer Graduate Merit Award** at North Carolina State University. It’s an incredible honor to be recognized among a small group of outstanding graduate students across the College, and the award includes a $3,000 prize.
* **Oct 16, 2024**: Our work on [**Jäger: Automated Telephone Call Traceback**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02839){:target="_blank"} was recognized with both the **Distinguished Paper Award** and the **Distinguished Artifact Award** at **ACM CCS 2024**.

## Invited Talks & Presentations

* **Upcoming (Sept 18, 2025)**: I have been invited to present our research on **Secure and Efficient Out-of-Band Call Metadata Transmission** at the [SIP Network Operators Conference (SIPNOC) 2025](https://www.sipforum.org/news-events/sipnoc-2025-overview/){:target="_blank"} in Herndon, VA. SIPNOC is a premier event for the VoIP and telecommunications industry, and I look forward to sharing our findings.
* **April 16, 2025**: I was invited to speak about our call traceback system, [**Jäger**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02839){:target="_blank"}, at the **North Carolina Annual Cybersecurity Symposium 2025**.
* **Oct 10, 2024**: I presented our paper, [**Jäger: Automated Telephone Call Traceback**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02839){:target="_blank"}, at **ACM CCS 2024**. You can [download the presentation slides here](../files/jager-slides.pptx){:download="jager-slides.pptx"}.

## Publications

* **July 2, 2025**: Our paper, **"How to Recover a Cryptographic Secret From the Cloud,"** was accepted to **ACM CCS 2025**. In this work with Tanner Verber, Alessandra Scafuro, and Chris Orsini, we introduce novel methods for secure secret recovery in cloud environments, a critical challenge as our infrastructure becomes increasingly cloud-dependent.
* **March 14, 2025**: Our paper, **"Towards Declarative Blockchains: A SHACL-Based Model for Robust and Efficient Transactions,"** was accepted to **IEEE ICBC 2025**. This research, in collaboration with Kemafor Anyanwu and Sogolsadat Mansouri, proposes a new model to improve blockchain integrity and performance using SHACL, a W3C standard for data validation.
* **Sept 23, 2024**: Our paper, [**"Jäger: Automated Telephone Call Traceback,"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02839){:target="_blank"} was accepted to **ACM CCS 2024**. Developed alongside Varun Madathil, Sathvik Prasad, Bradley Reaves, and Alessandra Scafuro, our system enables automated traceback of malicious telephone calls, a significant step in combating robocalls and telecom fraud.
